# MultData

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MultData is to provide ready-to-use datasets for teaching and learning multivariate data analysis techniques.

Absolutely no claims are made over the ownership of the data included in this package.

The datasets were found either:

1. on the internet (somewhere), or
2. among the files left by former staff on a shared network drive. 

There is no guarantee that data in these files is a perfect match for the printed data. Use them at your own risk.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MultData from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ajrgodfrey/MultData")
```
